  "presentation": "This is the very first app I built to familiarize myself with my own tool, since `construction is a very different process from use` (hi, uncle Bob). Needless to say, this first project had to be something special, rememberable, something that I've never done before.\nIt ended up being a To-Do list. So much for originality, but it allows for another lame nutin-related pun, so that's a fair tradeoff.\nWe'll use default settings, cover components, views and services, children components, and dynamic routing. We'll also use pipes and the built-in libraries snackbar and popover.",
