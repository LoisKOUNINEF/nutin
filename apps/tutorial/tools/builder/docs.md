- Adding additnal file formats to the build
Default file formats are `"html" "json" "ttf" "avif" "png" "jpg"`.          
Only the files in src/ that match one of the format are copied.
In `tools/builder/variables/file-types.js`, add desired format to existing list. Adding a file extension with no match in src/ will have no effect.
