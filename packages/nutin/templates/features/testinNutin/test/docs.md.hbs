# testin-nutin

***The test runner uses a Queue data structure, for which all credit goes to               ThePrimeagen and his [amazing Data Structures and Algorithms course on frontendmasters.com](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)*** 

## Run tests

The code needs to be compiled for the tests to run.

```sh
npm run test
npm run test:watch # NOTE: will rerun all tests on change.
npm run test--rebuild # = npm run build && npm run test 
``` 
Accepts a filter argument *ex: e2e, unit, file-name*.     

## Built-in features (minimalistic)

- *Test globals* : describe, it, beforeEach/All, afterEach/All.

- *Assertions library* : toBe(), toContain(string), toBeDefined, toBeUndefined, toBeInstanceOf(instance).                
All assertions can be used with `not.` prefix.

- *JSDOM initial setup for DOM testing*.

- *HTTP client mock* (In progress)

- *Automated tests discovery* : Recursively scans e2e/ unit/ and utils/ folders for .test.js files.                              
                             
It is always possible to add new paths in test/runner.js `testFiles` array (`...getTestFiles('path/to/folder')`) or remove one to disable its tests.           

- *mini-chalk* to color console outputs.

## How to use

Syntax is very similar to Jest, only with way less features.               
Import statements from 'dist' folder can be simplified by using `#root/dist/src` and by regrouping exports in indexes.                   
Please refer to examples in utils/\*.test.js and unit/i18n.test.js.
